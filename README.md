# Model-Interpretability-by-Shapash

# Shapash

Shapash is a Python library which aims to make machine learning interpretable and understandable to everyone. Shapash provides several types of visualization which displays explicit labels that everyone can understand. Data Scientists can more easily understand their models and share their results. End users can understand the decision proposed by a model using a summary of the most influential criteria. The project was developed by MAIF Data Scientists.

To Summarize and export the local explanation: Shapash proposes a short and clear local explanation. It allows each user, whatever their Data backround is, to understand a local prediction of a supervised model, thanks to a summarized and straightforward explanation

## Shapash features:

Uses Shap backend to display results in a few lines of code

Encoders objects and features dictionaries used for clear results

Compatible with category_encoders & Sklearn ColumnTransformer

Visualizations of global and local explainability

Webapp to easily navigate from global to local

Summarizes local explanation

Offers several parameters in order to sum up in the most suitable way for your use case

Exports your local summaries to Pandas DataFrames

Usable for Regression, Binary Classification or Multiclass

Compatible with most of sklearn, lightgbm, catboost, xgboost models

Relevant for exploration and also deployment (through an API or in Batch mode) for operational use

Shapash is easy to install and use: It provides a SmartExplainer class to understand your model and summarize explanation with a simple syntax.

High adaptability: Very few arguments are required to display results. But the more you work on cleaning and documenting the data, the clearer the results will be for the end user.
